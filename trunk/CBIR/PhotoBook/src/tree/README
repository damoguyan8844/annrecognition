The make_tree script will generate a tree for a specified database and
search metric. It should be run in the photobook-5.0 directory, and
"source sourceme" must be executed first, as usual. All output goes
into the data/<database> directory.

Programs used by make_tree:

results - computes the results of Photobook queries. May be useful on its own.

nnhierarchy - performs a Jarvis and Patrick nearest-neighbor
              clustering, as described in our TR#302.

simplify - eliminate tree nodes with a single child

These programs are under the same copyright as the Photobook distribution.
